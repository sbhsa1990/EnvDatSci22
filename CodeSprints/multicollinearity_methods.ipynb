        "In this tutorial, we will be using a spatial dataset of county-level election and demographic statistics for the United States. This time, we'll explore different methods to diagnose and account for multicollinearity in our data. Specifically, we'll calculate variance inflation factor (VIF), and compare parameter estimates and model fit in a multivariate regression predicting 2016 county voting preferences using an OLS model, a ridge regression, a lasso regression, and an elastic net regression.\n",

        "Objectives:\n",
        "* ***Calculate a variance inflation factor to diagnose multicollinearity.***\n",
        "* ***Use geographicall weighted regression to identify if the multicollinearity is scale dependent.***\n",
        "* ***Interpret model summary statistics.***\n",
        "* ***Describe how multicollinearity impacts stability in parameter esimates.***\n",
        "* ***Explain the variance/bias tradeoff and describe how to use it to improve models***\n",
