Oh git!
you may confuse me now,
but later you will make me less confused,

or, alternatively,
I will still be very confused;
only a semester's time will tell.
I really hope that maybe someday
I will be able to understand computer logic.

Who knows why we do the things we do.

python you are so complex
 I am perplexed
python you are so complex,
 I am perplexed
Python you are so complex,
I am perplexed

I hope that day is soon,
lets be friends

why must you make my life so hard by not letting me copy and paste
your commands do not make sense to me
I wish you were R

Microsoft bought GitHub, and the world is not ok
BRING BACK ATOM YOU COWARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I wish that you would show me how,
So you could then be used.

Who knows why we do the things we do.

I strive to learn your tricks,
however now it just gives me the icks,
I know I will continue to learn,
but currently it feels like heart burn

thanks for keeping track

Who knows why we are doing this?
I'm sure it's for the greater good.
Not just to pass this course,
Or get through graduate school.

Meow.

Who knows why we do the things we do.

because I don't worry about what confuses me,
and you confuse me now.

because I'll take a course,
named Data Science God!

and perhaps more and more amused

fork and clone seems harder,
but after some panic it is easy to understand,
my projects will be in order thanks to git.
Thank you git!

2. How are you, world today?

Who knows why we do the things we do.

You keep my data safe,
even when it's just cat memes
